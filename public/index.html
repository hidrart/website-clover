					<p class="description">
						The series focuses on Asta, a young orphan who is left to be raised in an orphanage alongside
						his fellow orphan, Yuno. While everyone is born with the ability to utilize mana in the form of
						magical power, Asta, with no magic however, instead focuses on physical strength. Conversely,
						Yuno was born as a prodigy with immense magical power and the talent to control wind magic.
						<br /><br />
						Motivated by a desire to become the next Wizard King, an authority figure second to the king of
						Clover Kingdom, the two youths developed a friendly rivalry. Yuno obtains a legendary four-leaf
						grimoire held by the kingdom's first Wizard King. The four-leaf grimoire is a rare grimoire,
						only given to the most immense mages. Asta, despite his lack of magic, obtained a mysterious
						five-leaf grimoire that contains mysterious elf swords and a bodiless member of the Devil race
						who utilizes rare anti-magic. Afterward, he and Yuno each join a Magic Knight squad as the first
						step to fulfill their ambitions.
						<br /><br />
						Asta joins the Black Bulls under Yami Sukehiro alongside Noelle Silva while Yuno becomes a
						member of the Golden Dawn, embarking on various adventures while contending with an extremist
						group called the Eye of the Midnight Sun whose leadership is manipulated by a Devil in avenging
						an injustice committed against the Elves by the Clover Kingdom at the time of its founding. The
						Magic Knights then face the Dark Triad of the Spade Kingdom, with Asta and Yuno learning of
						their Devils’ influence on their lives and of the Dark Triad’s plan to fully manifest the Devils
						into their world.

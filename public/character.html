						Black Clover is a Japanese manga written and illustrated by Yūki Tabata. The story follows Asta,
						a young boy born without any magic power. This is unknown to the world he lives in because
						seemingly everyone has some sort of magic power. With his fellow mages from the Black Bulls,
						Asta plans to become the next Wizard King.

						<h2>Asta</h2>
						<p class="description">
							As the main protagonist on the show and future Emperor of the Clover Kingdom, Asta is easily
							the most powerful character on the show. Defined by his Anti-Magic skills which enable him
							to nullify every single other character's supernatural attacks, Asta is a uniquely talented
							warrior who will outwit and overpower his opponents through speed, swordsmanship, strategy,
							intellect, and his sixth-sense Ki. Moreover, when Asta is in devil form under the possession
							of Liebe, he has access to an omnipotent 5-leaf grimoire that allows him to neutralize
							Gravity Singularity and add additional weapons to his arsenal. Best of all, Asta's four
							Anti-Magic swords, including Yami's Demon-Slasher Katana, are the most powerful weapons in
							Black Clover.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div class="review">
						<h2>Yuno Grinberryall</h2>
						<p class="description">
							As Asta's most trusted foster brother and protective sidekick on the popular demon-slaying
							anime, Yuno makes up for Asta's lack of magical power through his unique abilities. Thanks
							to his four-leaf grimoire and half-elf possession, Yuno can wield Wind Magic, Creation
							Magic, Spirit Magic, Star Magic which enables him to manipulate the cosmos, create deadly
							objects out of thin air, and more. Yuno bolsters his power by using Spirit Magic to summon
							Sylph, a wind spirit that can help him fight battles. When channeling 100% of Sylph's
							energy, Yuno obtains enough mana to reach Saint-Stage, the highest form of devil-abolishing
							magic.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div class="review">
						<h2>Noelle Silva</h2>
						<p class="description">
							As a Royal Member of House Silva, Noelle Silva is one of the most formidable main characters
							due to her immensely powerful Water Magic, which she can use to create and control real
							water, launch deadly water balls at her foes, and conjure giant lethal aqueous entities in a
							flash. What's more, Noelle significantly increases her overall prowess once she is possessed
							by Undine, the almighty water spirit. When Noelle harnesses Undine's power, she becomes a
							Saint-Stage mage strong enough to defeat most elves with extremely potent offensive curses.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div class="review">
						<h2>Vanessa Enoteca</h2>
						<p class="description">
							Vanessa is one of a handful of women from a special part of the Clover Kingdom inaccessible
							to most. Deep inside the forests, there exists a land of witches—all mages with their own
							power, left alone by the rest of the kingdom. These women aren’t supposed to live outside
							the forest, and people from the outside are supposed to be forbidden.It’s unsurprising
							considering what we know about her backstory, but Vanessa is actually in love with Yami.
							It’s rarely discussed, but because Yami saved her life when she was so young, she fell for
							the man. When she talks about the kind of man that’s her type, she’s almost always
							describing a man that’s exactly like Yami.
